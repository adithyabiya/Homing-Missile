# Homing-Missile
The Source codes of all assets including the follow camera has been uploaded in the assets folder 

This repository contains a Unity 3D project showcasing a homing missile system. The system is designed to simulate the behavior of a guided missile that can lock onto targets and pursue them dynamically.

Features:

1. Missile Guidance: The project demonstrates a sophisticated homing mechanism that enables the missile to track and follow targets with high accuracy. The guidance system relies on real-time target detection and predictive algorithms to ensure efficient target tracking.
2. Target Lock-on: The missile system incorporates a lock-on feature that allows the missile to acquire and maintain a lock on a target until impact. This ensures that the missile stays on course, even when the target is moving or evading.
3. Proximity Detonation: Upon reaching its target, the missile can explode with a proximity detonation effect, creating a satisfying visual and audio feedback.
4. Particle Effects: The project includes visually appealing particle effects to enhance the missile's appearance and create an immersive experience.
